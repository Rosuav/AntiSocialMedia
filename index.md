Anti-Social Media
=================

I would say "welcome to Anti-Social Media" but that would miss the point.

Features
--------

Check out our huge list of features:

* Create posts about what you do! They won't be shown to anybody.
* Check your feed of what everyone else has done! It'll be comfortingly empty.
* Post comments on other people's posts that show up in your feed! Except that
  there won't ever be any.
* Like, comment, subscribe, follow, endorse, star, and reanti your friends'
  posts! Those you can see, anyhow.

Sign up?

Signups are by invitation only. If you want to join Anti-Social Media, find a

pristine emptiness of this service, no such invitations will be issued.
